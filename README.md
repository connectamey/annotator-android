## SpeechRecognizer

App to record activities in realtime (In Development)

The [SpeechRecognizer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer) class provides access to the speech recognition service. 

The app must declare ```Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO``` permission and request it at runtime.

A ```<queries>``` element must be declared to interact with the service.
